The bank is experiencing difficulties in retaining customers. Attracting new customers is expensive, and it is more cost-effective to retain those about whom some information is already available. It is necessary to analyze the bank's customers and identify segments of customers who are prone to leaving the bank. **Research Goal:** Reduce customer churn. **Objective:** Identify homogeneous customer segments that maximize coverage of problem areas.

## Summary

**General Observations**

From the analysis, it appears that churn is more prevalent among wealthier clients with:
- Higher-than-average balances.
- Good credit scores.
- Ownership of multiple financial products.
- Higher property evaluations.

Additionally:
- Missing values in the balance field were assumed to indicate the absence of a checking account. Clients in this category typically own just one product, most often a credit card, and exhibit a lower churn rate.

**Segment-Specific Recommendations Analysis:**

**Segment 0**:
- Promote property-saving products, such as insurance or investment programs, due to the medium/high property evaluations.
- Offer higher deposit interest rates for balances exceeding 1 million or alternative investment programs to retain clients with large account balances.
- Reassess the range of offered products, as clients may be accumulating products they find irrelevant or of insufficient quality, leading to churn. Note that more loyal clients tend to have no more than two products, likely including a credit card.
- For clients indicating potential churn, provide retention incentives, such as fee reductions or bonus rewards for maintaining balances above a certain threshold.

**Segment 1:**
- Propose lending programs or credit cards, considering their good credit scores and positive account balances.
- Introduce special loan products with flexible terms, such as reduced interest rates or deferred payments, to encourage borrowing without burdening these clients.
- Suggest bundled products, such as credit cards tied to investment accounts or property loans, to meet diverse financial needs.

**Segment 2:**
- Advertise credit products, including those involving collateral acceptance, and promote credit cards.
- Encourage these clients to open checking accounts to facilitate easier access to funds and enhance loyalty to the bank.
- Offer networking events, investment clubs, or similar opportunities that appeal to this age group and wealth level, fostering deeper engagement.

**General Recommendations for All Segments:**
1. Investigate Missing Balance Values
2. Conduct exit surveys or interviews with clients who churn to gather feedback about dissatisfaction with products, service quality, or other factors
3. Use predictive analytics to identify clients at risk of churning and proactively engage them with retention offers or personalized financial advice
4. Use personalized marketing and communications tailored to the preferences and behaviors of each segment. For example:
- Highlight security and wealth growth for Segment 0
- Emphasize flexibility and rewards for Segment 1
- Promote stability and opportunities for Segment 2.
